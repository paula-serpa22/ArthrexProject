# 5. Preliminary operational concept of proposed system

## 5.1 Preliminary operational concept

### a) operational policies and constraints
Arthrex job portal could be a little complicated for students to be able to find opportunites. Currently Arthrex has a separated portal for software engineering positions. A constraint could be that it requres a new page creation maybe a microsite, that is linked to the principal job portal in the website. Also, it would be neccesary to promote in social media this new page so students would find out about it. 


### b) description of the proposed system
This new page will be a job portal only dedicated to college students so they can find internships opportunities in an easier way.

### c) modes of system operation

Kernel and User modes

### d) user classes and other involved personnel 
This project would require team work in between developers, BA, UX designers, Content specialists, and QA team.

### e) support environment

Github, CMS, Kontent, Webflow, JIRA

## 5.2 Preliminary operational scenarios

College students will interact with this new "interns job portal" in the website in order to find internships in an user-friendly interface.

# 6. Other preliminary life-cycle concepts

## 6.1 Preliminary acquisition concept

User experience research is fundamental for building requirements definitions because even though Arthrex would be the "client," the truth is to build the requirements is necessary to interview college students about their current opinion about the job portal and what features they consider could make their navigating experience better. After requirements definition process, design will involve team work with developers, UX designers, and bussiness analyst.

## 6.2 Preliminary deployment concept

After working on the project and finishing it, the website - code will go through a Quality Assurance process in which, we will team up to identify if the page is functional, user-friendly, and go according to the requirements established.

## 6.3 Preliminary support concept

To support the "new interns job portal" after it's deployed, it would require maintenance support (developers and I,) QA support, and Content team support, 

## 6.4 Preliminary retirement concept

After the deployment, a new cleanup project would begin, to identify features that might not be necesary and can be removed.


# 7. Project Constraints

The company is closing the fiscal year, so this prpject won't star until next fiscal year begins.
